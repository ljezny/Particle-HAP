RCSwitch

About
-----

This is a [RCSwitch](https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/) fork for [Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/).

### Send RC codes

Use your Arduino to operate remote radio controlled devices. This will most likely work with all popular low cost power outlet sockets.

All you need is a Arduino, a 315/433MHz AM transmitter (find out [where to get one](https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/wiki/List_TransmitterReceiverModules) or [hack your existing remote control](https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/wiki/HowTo_HackRemoteControl)) and one or more devices with a SC5262 / SC5272, HX2262 / HX2272, PT2262 / PT2272, EV1527, RT1527, FP1527 or HS1527 chipset. Also supports Intertechno outlets.

### Receive and decode RC codes

Find out what codes your remote is sending. Use your remote to control your Arduino.

All you need is a Arduino, a 315/433MHz AM receiver (altough there is no instruction yet, yes it is possible to hack an existing device) and a remote hand set.
